<h1 align="center">ABOUT US</h1>
<div class="center">
<p align="center">A shopping cart or trolley , also known by a variety of other names, is a cart supplied by a shop, 
especially supermarkets, for use by customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the checkout counter
 during shopping. In many cases customers can then also use the cart to transport their purchased goods to their vehicles,
  but some carts are designed to prevent them from leaving the shop.</p>
